# Clashpoint for Arma 3

## Current version : v1.6

## Overview

ClashPoint is the closest equivalent to an instant action feature in Arma 3. It's the fastest way to go from the main menu to a cool firefight! You can play the way you want: solo, coop or PvP.

* Fight to control the ClashPoint in dynamically generated infantry firefights on numerous different locations across the entire island,
* You can choose to play solo, coop, PvP, and the mission will adapt to the number of players,
* You can play the mission as a singleplayer scenario (you will join AI forces), on a local server, or dedicated server,
* Motorized reinforcements and close air support to help the losing team and even out the fight,
* Spawn protection to discourage those nasty spawn campers,
* Cool killfeed that displays all your bragging rights!
